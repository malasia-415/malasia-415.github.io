           Hello! My name is Malasia Woods 21 years young software engineer. I was born and raised in San Francisco
           but located to Stockton when I was 17. I play around with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I chose coding because I wanted to improve my knowledge on how to communicate to computers, and build my skills on technical speaking.
           I also really enjoy working with other great programmers in a group and experiencing good collaboration, solving problems are a plus, and its 
           perfect stimulation, also coding is a good way to practice your professionalism. I'm a soon to be graduate from Thinkful bootcamp.
           My dream is to become a retail business owner of my own fashion company.
