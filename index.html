            Hello! My name is Malasia Woods! I am a software engineer. I was born and raised in San Francisco but relocated to Stockton when I was 17. I have experimented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Initially, 
            I chose to code because I wanted to improve my knowledge of technology and to build my technical speaking skills. 
            I also enjoy working with other great programmers and solving problems with them. I hope to continue to collaborate with others in the future. 
            I will be graduating from Thinkful Engineering Flex program. Also, besides, I look forward to using my coding skills in the Fashion industry.
        </p>

        <p>Another hobby that I have other than Apparel design, is cooking. In my spare time, I find cooking big meals for my family to be stress-relieving.</p>
   
        
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
            I've created a quiz that people could test their knowledge about cats. 
            It's made for people that like cats. At the end of the quiz, it gives you the total number 
            score of your right and wrong answers from the quiz. What inspired me to create this app was because 
            growing up I would adopt so many stray kittens and I became truly fascinated with them and did some research. 
            Tech stack used to create this app: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p>I've created a Masks app that users are able to search in categories of masks on sale from Etsy.
           It's made for people to search all masks in color, price, material and also by keywords available on the Etsy website. 
           I was inspired by the COVID-19 epidemic. And the lack of being able to have easy purchase access to face protection.
           Tech stack used to create the app: HTML, CSS, and ReactJS and NodeJS
        </p>

         <p>I've created a calculator app for users to solve math problems or even add up money whenever they want. 
            I was inspired by hard workers that will always need a handy dandy calculator for fast use. Tech stack used to 
            create the app: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and API fetching.
